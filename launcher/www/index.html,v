    <title>Thinkwink Launcher Project</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>The Launcher project is aimed squarely at all java users.  To the typical user, you can use this
    project to clean up your startup code.  No more worrying about classpaths, just stick them in the lib
    directory.  No more worrying about writing splash screens.  Just write an html one or create an image
    and stick em in the splash directory.  Just edit the launcher.properties file and you're ready to go.
    You dont even need to memori.ze XML.  Just set it and forget it!
	
	<p>And dont forget your java beginners.  What better way to start programming java without the classpath
	frustration!  This will make it much easier on the beginner to focus on the "code" aspect of java
	programming.
