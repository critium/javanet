old java.net projects.

launcher is a java launcher.  Just place all the jars, classes, etc in a directory.  Built in classloader will load all jars, and classes and launch the Main class as set in the setting file.

switchboard is a fully functional active record implementation.  Uses custom annotations (very similar to jpa) and supports all databases that apache torque supports.
